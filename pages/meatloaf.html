                <h2>Description</h2>
                    <p>The secrets to this meatloaf are fresh, very finely diced
vegetables that give it moisture and flavor--and a light touch in mixing together 
the ingredients. This hearty meatloaf is the perfect meal for cool fall and winter 
evenings, served with mashed potatoes and simple mushroom gravy.</p>

                            <li>1 teaspoon olive oil</li>
                        </ul>

                    <h3>Glaze Ingredients</h3>
                        <ul>
                            <li>2 tablespoons brown sugar</li>
                            <li>2 tablespoons ketchup</li>
                            <li>2 tablespoons Dijon mustard</li>
                            <li>hot pepper sauce to taste</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h4>Directions</h4>
                            <ol>
                              <li>Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F.</li>
                              <li>Place the carrot, celery, onion, red bell pepper,
mushrooms, and garlic in a food processor, and pulse until very finely chopped, almost
to a puree. Place the minced vegetables into a large mixing bowl, and mix in ground
chuck, Worcestershire sauce, and egg. Add Italian herbs, salt, black pepper, and
cayenne pepper. Mix gently with a wooden spoon to incorporate vegetables and egg
into the meat. Pour in bread crumbs. With your hand, gently mix in the crumbs with 
your fingertips just until combined, about 1 minute.</li>
                              <li>Form the meatloaf into a ball. Pour olive oil
into a baking dish and place the ball of meat into the dish. Shape the ball into 
a loaf, about 4 inches high by 6 inches across.</li>
                              <li>Bake in the preheated oven just until the meatloaf
is hot, about 15 minutes.</li>
                              <li>Meanwhile, in a small bowl, mix together brown
sugar, ketchup, Dijon mustard, and hot sauce. Stir until the brown sugar has dissolved.</li>
                              <li>Remove the meatloaf from the oven. With the back
of a spoon, smooth the glaze onto the top of the meatloaf, then pull a little bit
of glaze down the sides of the meatloaf with the back of the spoon.</li>
                              <li>Return meatloaf to oven, and bake until the loaf
is no longer pink inside and the glaze has baked onto the loaf, 30 to 40 more minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the thickest part of the loaf should read at least 160 degrees F (70 degrees C). Cooking time will depend on shape and thickness of the meatloaf.</li>
